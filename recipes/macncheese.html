        <h4>Old School Mac n' Cheese</h4>
        <p>Mac n' cheese just like grandma used to make it, including the potato chip crust!</p>
        <p>It's easy to make, and perfect for a pot luck.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ pounds whole-wheat macaroni</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages shredded American cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) bag potato chips (such as Lay's®), crushed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
                 stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly;
                 cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk
                 into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds;
                 repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir
                 Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture;
                 season with salt and black pepper.</li>
